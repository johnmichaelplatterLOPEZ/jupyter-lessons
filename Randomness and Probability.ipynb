    "\n",
    "As a quick recap: probability is a math term that refers to how **likely** something is to happen. Probabilities can be expressed as a fraction or decimal between 0 and 1, where **0** is the probability of something that *can't ever happen*, **1** is the probability of something that will *always happen no matter what*, and an outcome with probability **0.5** or **$\\frac{1}{2}$** will likely happen half the time. (2 out of 4 tries, 10 out of 20 tries, 50 out of 100 tries, and so on)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The math concept of probability is completely tied to the idea of randomness. When situations are random, there's no certain way to predict how they will turn out. We can only make guesses that some outcomes are likely and others are unlikely. A standard example is a coin flip - we can be pretty certain that \"heads\" will be face up about $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the time, so the probability is **0.5**. However, every time you wake up, you are on planet Earth, so the likelyhood that you are on Earth when you wake up in the morning is virtually **1**. (in the year 2020 at least) \n",

    "I'm sure you can think of a fun example for an outcome that has a **0** probability...\n",
